Personal \ninformatics can serve a goal-driven purpose, such as tracking \nweight loss, increasing physical activity, having a record of \nplaces  visited,  or  tracking  student  loan  payments.  Beyond \nthese goal-driven motivations, self-tracking tools are now a \npart  of  everyday  life,  or  \u201clived  informatics\u201d,  with  people \ntracking out of curiosity or a fascination with numbers [34]. \nThe pervasiveness of self-tracking tools has led researchers \nto  study  people\u2019s  use  of  commercial  tools  for  tracking \nlocation  [24,30],  finances  [20],  food  [11],  weight  [19,25], \nand  physical  activity  [16,34]  and  to  develop  research \nprototypes to expand our understanding of usage [3,8,12,40]. \n\nPermission  to  make  digital  or  hard  copies  of  all  or  part  of  this  work  for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear  this  notice  and  the  full  citation  on  the  first  page.

For  some  trackers,  engagement  with  and  gaining  an \nunderstanding  of  personal  data  may  be  the  goal  in  itself, \ncausing the action stage to be foregone [41]. Reflection often \noccurs  during  collection  rather  than  being  a  separate  stage \n[6], which leads to an alternative three-stage iterative model \nof configuration, data capture, and feedback [7]. \n\nHowever,  research  on  everyday  self-tracking  behavior \nidentifies several uses of personal informatics not described \nby  current  models.  For  example,  the  five-stage  model \ndescribes  self-trackers  switching  tools  to  better  fit  their \ninformation  needs  [21].  People  also  switch  tools  because \ntheir  devices  break  [16,34],  they  change  phones  [34],  or \nbecause \n[34]. \nSelf-trackers also fail to sustain the habit or get frustrated and \ngive up on tools [11]. Articulating a model that encompasses \nthese behaviors can offer better guidance to designers.  \n\nreceive  a  new \n\nrecommendation \n\nthey \n\nTo develop this model, we studied self-tracking of a variety \nof behaviors to understand how lived informatics manifests \nin the habits of self-trackers. Specifically, we surveyed 105, \n99,  and  83  past  and  present  trackers  of  physical  activity, \nfinances,  and  location  on  their  habits  and  conducted  22 \ninterviews. We report on how people decide to start tracking \nand pick a tool, how they use that tool, how and why people \nswitch  between  tools,  and  why  people  stop  tracking.  We \ndevelop  an  expanded  model  that  captures  the  practices  of \nself-trackers  motivated  to  track  to  change  behaviors, \ninstrumenting an activity, and curiosity. \n\nSpecifically, we find: \n\u2022  In  addition  to  being  motivated  to  track  in  support  of \nbehavior change goals, people start tracking to instrument \nan activity or out of pure curiosity. \n\n\u2022  People\u2019s  motivations  for  tracking  guide  the  selection  of \ntracking  tools.  Behavior-change  trackers  do  substantial \nbackground  research  and  optimize  a  tool  for  their  goal, \ninstrumental  trackers  try  to  maximize  their  benefit  from \nthe  tools,  and  curiosity-driven  trackers  often  do  not \nactively consider tool selection. \n\n731\n\n \n \n \n \n\f\u2022  Usage of tools varies by domain and reason for tracking, \nprimarily  because  people\u2019s  motivations  are  different  in \neach domain. Behavior change trackers collect and review \ndata  frequently  and  are  bothered  by  inaccurate  logs, \ninstrumental trackers track when the benefits outweigh the \neffort, and curiosity-driven trackers are motivated by how \ninteresting they find the data they are tracking. \n\n\u2022  People frequently switch tools, and in doing so learn about \n\nwhat and how they are interested in tracking.  \n\n\u2022  People  lapse  in  their  tool  use  in  four  different  ways: \ntrack,  difficulty  managing  upkeep, \n\nforgetting \nintentionally skipping entries, and suspending tracking. \n\nto \n\nThese  findings  inform  a  revised  model  of  how  people  use \nself-tracking  tools,  independent  of  original  motivation, \nsupplementing  the  stage-based  model  for  behavior-change \ntracking. This informs a set of open design problems: \n\u2022  Designing to resume tracking after a lapse, including how \nto use historical data collected before, or even during, the \nlapse.  For  example,  should  a  food  journal  present \nsomeone\u2019s  previous  eating  habits  when  they  decide  to \nresume tracking to aid in weight loss? If so, how? \n\n\u2022  Designing to avoid inertia around a long-used tool that no \nlonger  supports  a  self-tracker\u2019s  goal.  For  example,  how \ncan a financial tracking tool integrate historical data and \nprovide an intuitive interface to a person who has managed \ntheir finances with a custom spreadsheet for years? \n\n\u2022  Designing to support people\u2019s various goals and transitions \nbetween  them.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3861, "end_char_idx": 7844, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70e1700a-03bf-4146-ac1d-4f2b7c217b03": {"__data__": {"id_": "70e1700a-03bf-4146-ac1d-4f2b7c217b03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "477ab99b-3d28-4ada-bda3-f83dfdb36c39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1a6c925ff8699035da909b24fe4b494aac89e3e8c7ebf2f2218cfa4b1d2aaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec3e1101-28da-4f9f-b04a-2897aebcc92e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd033b42943f7e0ab97349be6c5f9a7239eaafa83b2af07e8a5ba313e66d23dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2777788-893e-4a88-986e-240b3b407250", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51c67438105eba8c4feb23cae13db061b88a9fc07881f398788cc94eabe7c4e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022  Designing to support people\u2019s various goals and transitions \nbetween  them.

The model has five stages: 1) preparation, or \nstarting to collect data and thinking about what information \nto  record  and  how  to  collect  it;  2)  collection,  or  gathering \ndata;  3)  integration,  or  preparing  data  to  reflect  upon; \n4) reflection, or examining and exploring data; and 5) action, \nor  taking  one\u2019s  newfound  understanding  of  themselves  to \ninform changes. Motivated by the Transtheoretical Model of \nBehavior  Change  (TTM)  [32],  Li  et  al.  later  identify  two \nphases  of  reflection,  discovery  and  maintenance,  and  note \npeople ask different types of questions in each phase [22]. \n\nFrom  studying  practices  of  the  Quantified  Self  movement, \nChoe  et  al.  learn  that  reflection  often  occurs  when  data  is \ncaptured  [6]  and  propose  a  new  model  for  self-monitoring \n\n732\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7\u201311, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\nFigure 1.

Similarly, Whooley et al. note the \npotential  for  personal  informatics  tools  to  support  Sch\u00f6n\u2019s \nreflection-in-action  [36],  where  self-trackers  contemplate \ntheir data and change their behavior while tracking [41]. \n\nThese models describe trackers who have a behavior change \ngoal, but some have other motivations. People also self-track \nfor self-understanding [34], never acting upon their data. \n\nStarting to Track \nMany people start tracking because they have goals in mind \n[15,19,22,34].  Weight  trackers  often  have  a  specific  target \nweight,  and  use  the  weight  as  a  proxy  for  their  progress \ntowards  other  fitness  goals  [19].  Although  many  physical \nactivity  trackers  track  to  change  or  maintain  a  behavior, \nothers  start  without  a  specific  goal or use  tools  to help  set \ngoals (e.g., determine what actions to take to fix a problem \n[22] or identify the \u201cbaseline\u201d to observe changes [34]). \n\nRewards, such as discounts or badges, motivate many people \nto track location (e.g., Foursquare [24]) and physical activity \n[34].  Some  start  tracking  physical  activity  to  generate \nincome  (e.g.,  recording  workouts  on  Pact)  [34].  Many \nFoursquare  users  also  start  tracking  to  offer  awareness  to \nfriends  and  see  where  they  are, or  simply  to  keep  track  of \nplaces  they  have  been  (e.g.,  bars  and  restaurants)  [21]. \nPeople also start tracking to keep a record for later retrieval, \nsuch as TV shows and movies watched [22]. \n\nAnother  common  motivation  to  start  tracking  is  out  of \ncuriosity [24] or an interest in quantitative data [21].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7766, "end_char_idx": 11481, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2777788-893e-4a88-986e-240b3b407250": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2777788-893e-4a88-986e-240b3b407250", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "477ab99b-3d28-4ada-bda3-f83dfdb36c39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1a6c925ff8699035da909b24fe4b494aac89e3e8c7ebf2f2218cfa4b1d2aaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70e1700a-03bf-4146-ac1d-4f2b7c217b03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "354e9020fa1a0d1019276f4892e9cb4986ffbf01dd44ad0175fb3e64b4e734c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "32679752-3bf3-4933-a8fc-831ce268c9c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5e550a8b4c9a3432f56f633e17c473bcfe0341fe1180cc74ee9d06b74b5213c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Some \nfood journalers [11] and physical activity trackers [34] start \ntracking  to  learn  more  about  their  behavior,  such  as  their \neating habits or steps walked in their daily commute. \n\nPeople  select  specific  tracking  tools  based  on  features, \nbranding,  convenience  (e.g.,  whether  it  is  easy  to  carry), \nrecommendations of friends and relatives, and reviews in app \nstores  and  media  [20,21,34].  People  often  receive  tools  as \ngifts, which is a selection on their behalf [34]. \n\nHow People Track \nPeople collect personal data with varying frequency based on \nthe kind of data. For example, food consumption is typically \n\n \n \n\fSESSION: PERSUASIVE AND PERSONAL\n\ntracked several times a day, while one may only track books \nread a few times per month [21]. People may also track only \nsome of their activities (e.g., particular cycle rides or hikes), \nor everything (e.g., a food log or a complete step count) [34]. \n\nThe length of tool usage varies by domain. Many who track \nphysical activity have kept records for a year or more [16], \nthough newcomers reduce the average duration of use [34]. \nFinancial  trackers  use  tools  for  longer,  such  as  non-digital \nsystems to keep track of investment in municipal bonds for \nnearly 50 years [20]. Food journalers vary in how long they \nkeep the habit, ranging from 1 week to over 2 years, with a \nmedian  of  7-12  months  [10].  Tool  usage  also  varies  by \navailability. Commercial activity trackers are much newer than \nnon-digital methods often used to track finances and food. \n\nPeople rarely maintain use of the same tool and often switch \nand  mix  tools  when  tracking  [34].  Some  people  track  the \nsame  habit  with  two  tools,  which  leads  to  synchronization \ncomplications  (e.g.,  step  tracking  with  a  pedometer  and  a \nphone  app  syncing  to  MyFitnessPal)  [21].  Others  track \ndifferent types of activities with different tools (e.g., Map My \nRun  for  running  and  Wii  Fit  for  weight  monitoring  [34]), \nwhich  usually  leads  to  difficulties  in  organizing  and \nreviewing data across separate tools and formats [21]. \n\nMany  physical  activity  trackers  look  at  their  information \nimmediately  after  collection  [21]  to  gain  awareness  of \ncurrent status and correct behavior towards goals (e.g., see \ntheir current step total and how many more steps needed for \n10,000  steps)  [16,34].  Some  people  show  little  interest  in \nreflecting on long-term data [34], while others use it to see \npatterns and trends over time [22]. Financial trackers use the \nidea of a financial touch, or a quick glimpse at data to gain \nawareness into their financial situations [20]. \n\nPeople change their goals and practices over time, which is \nnot  well-supported  by  personal  informatics  systems  [22]. \nThese changes sometimes lead to selecting a new tool [21]. \nSome people who start without clear goals narrow their data \ncollection once they identify actionable goals, moving from \ndiscovery  phase  to  maintenance  phase  of  reflecting  [22]. \nPeople also switch tools as their practices evolve over time \nand  what  a  system  supports  does  no  longer  matches  their \npriorities (e.g., a jogger starting to do yoga) [16]. \n\nLapsing and Infrequent Use \nDocumentary  tracking  focuses  on  documenting  activities \ninstead  of  changing  them.  It  can  be  accomplished  with  a \nrelatively short-term endeavor to build up a collection of data \nfor reflection, and many people stop tracking after reflecting \n[34]. However, this is not true for everyone. Some long-term \nphysical  activity  trackers  continue  to  track  after  they  have \nlearned  their  patterns  and  routines,  because  they  either \nbenefit  from  the  continuous  reflection  or  the  application \ncontinues to keep a record without interaction (e.g., passively \nrecording activity from phone accelerometer data) [16].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11482, "end_char_idx": 15409, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32679752-3bf3-4933-a8fc-831ce268c9c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "32679752-3bf3-4933-a8fc-831ce268c9c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "477ab99b-3d28-4ada-bda3-f83dfdb36c39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1a6c925ff8699035da909b24fe4b494aac89e3e8c7ebf2f2218cfa4b1d2aaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2777788-893e-4a88-986e-240b3b407250", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51c67438105eba8c4feb23cae13db061b88a9fc07881f398788cc94eabe7c4e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e2bbbf3-3f3c-4276-bc80-9d7189d3fd46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "742fc739ceb5180ef58d9490b9bc89a5bb9784118aa0f43d978f92a609143e5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In studies of research prototypes, some participants reduce \ntheir interactions from a daily basis to a few times a week as \n\nstudies  progress  [23].

We  strived  for diversity  in \nthe  types  of  data  tracked,  similar  to  the  original  five-stage \nmodel  [21]  and  its  proposed  expansions  and  clarifications \n[6,22,41]. Physical activity was selected because it is perhaps \nthe most common topic of self-tracking today, is included by \ndefault with present and announced wearables (e.g., Apple \nHealthKit and Watch, Microsoft Band), and is often studied \nwhen  making  broader  claims  about  personal  informatics \n(e.g.,  [15,16,34]).  Finances  were  selected  because  people \nhave  long  tracked  them  manually  (e.g.,  ledgers  and  then \nspreadsheets) and there are now tools that support tracking \nfinances  automatically  (e.g.,  tools  from  a  bank  or  an \naggregator such as Mint.com). Location tracking is common \nand  is  a  historically  important  branch  of  research  in  the \nUbicomp  community  (e.g.  [9,18,24,37,38]).  Prior  work \nsuggests  that  location  tracking  may  differ  from  the  other \ndomains, in that it is often socially motivated and goals are \ntypically  less  articulated  and  numeric  compared  to  other \ndomains.  The  equivalent  of  \u201cwalk  10,000  steps  today\u201d  or \n\u201csave $1,000 this month\u201d is unclear for location tracking. \n\nSurvey Methods \nWe surveyed people on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), \nwhich has been shown to be closer to U.S. demographics than \nconventional convenience samples [5]. One potential concern \nis that people on AMT potentially represent a younger, more \ntechnologically  literate  population,  but  we  believe  this  is \nconsistent with demographics of current self-trackers. \n\nfurther \n\nresponse  quality,  we \n\nWe restricted participation to Turkers in the United States. \nrestricted \nTo  ensure \nparticipation to Turkers who had a task acceptance rate of at \nleast  95%  and  had  completed  at  least  1,000  tasks.

Finally,  Turkers  were  presented  a  short  free \nresponse question that the first author analyzed for quality, a \nrecommended  practice  in  AMT  surveys  [14].  We  rejected \nthree  tasks  as  spam:  two  left  the  free  response  question \neffectively  blank  (e.g.,  \u201cN/A\u201d);  one  did  not  enter  a  code \nshowing they had completed the survey. \n\nWe  invited  each  Turker  who  had  self-tracked  in  a  domain \n(i.e.,  physical  activity,  location,  finances)  to  complete  a \nlonger survey for that domain.

People self-track in many other domains, \nincluding to manage chronic illnesses, in which people might \nhave different motivations or tracking habits. Although we \nbelieve our findings are extensible to domains other than the \nthree on which we report (e.g., biometric or food tracking), \nthey do not necessarily cover all motivations and usages. \n\nSome  people  track  the  domains  we  study  using  different \nclasses of tools that we do not extensively report on, such as \ntools that passively record location (e.g., Moves, SenseCam \n[17]).  Although  we  believe  this  suggests  these  are  used \nrelatively  infrequently  compared  to  those  we  report  on \n(or  possible  limitations  in  our  recruitment  techniques),  our \nfindings  on  tracking  in  a  particular  domain  may  not \ngeneralize to all tools or people tracking that type of data. \n\nWe  believe  our  recruitment  overrepresents  people  who \ncurrently  identify  as  self-trackers,  as  our  recruitment \nmaterials  were  likely  to  draw  people  who  were  currently \ninterested in self-tracking (e.g., posting the task on AMT as \na  \u201cSurvey  on  Location,  Physical  Activity,  and  Finance \nTracking\u201d). This is one weakness of our research, and future \nwork  should  further  explore  people\u2019s  reasons  for  deciding \nnot to return to tracking. \n\nDEVELOPMENT OF A LIVED INFORMATICS MODEL \nBased on results of our survey and interviews, we develop a \nnew  model  of  personal  informatics  reflecting  a  \u201clived \ninformatics\u201d [34] view of usage. The stage-based model [21] \nassumes a desire for action, which we believe corresponds to \nthe  behavior  change  nature  of  the  model  but  does  not \nencompass self-tracking motivated for other reasons. \n\nFurthermore, Li et al.\u2019s model describes people switching to \na  new  tool  when  their  current  tool  does  not  meet  their \ninformation needs [21]. We have found that people\u2019s reasons \nfor switching tools are more varied. The prior models also do \nnot describe the ways in which and reasons why people  lapse \nin their tracking or stop entirely [11]. We integrate lapses and \nresumption into our model, which appears in Figure 2. \n\nDeciding to Track \nWe divide the preparation stage of Li et al.\u2019s model [21] into \ntwo stages: deciding and selecting. The deciding stage refers \nto the decision to track personal data. This stage mirrors the \nprecontemplation and contemplation stages of the TTM for \npeople with  a behavior change goal  [32]. People decide to \ntrack for varied reasons, including to see other\u2019s activity, to \nshare  activity  with  others,  to  receive  rewards,  or  curiosity. \nPeople can decide to track having never tracked before, or \ncan return to tracking from a prior experience. \n\n734\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fSESSION: PERSUASIVE AND PERSONAL\n\nFigure  2.

It  includes  the  process  of  deciding  to  track\nand  selecting  tools,  tracking  and  acting  as  an  ongoing\nprocess  of  collection,  integration,  and  reflection,  and\nlapsing of tracking that may later be resumed. \n\nSelecting Tools \nFollowing  the  decision  to  track,  people  select  a  tool  with \nwhich to track. This is sometimes minimal or coupled with \nthe decision to track (e.g., when someone received a tracking \ntool as a gift and decides to use it). This decision can also be \ndifficult  and  require  extensive  comparison  of  tools  (e.g., \nonline,  through  brief  use).  Tool  selection  can  depend  on \nfeatures,  aesthetics,  and  convenience,  and  choices  can  be \nlimited by the tracker\u2019s mobile platform or budget. \n\nTracking and Acting \nChoe [7] and Whooley et al.

These three \nactivities are distinct and do have data dependencies, but in \ncontrast to Li et al.\u2019s model [21] we do not separate them into \nstages. These activities can and do occur simultaneously. \n\nLapsing \nThe lapsing stage occurs when someone stops actively using \na self-tracking tool. Lapsing typically begins with barriers to \ncollection, but can also be caused by barriers to integration \nor reflection [21]. We later describe four categories of lapses: \nforgetting,  upkeep,  skipping,  and  suspending.  For  some,  a \nlapse is a temporary break in tracking, while others do not \nreturn to tracking and have no intention to track again. \n\nResuming \nShort-term lapses (e.g., forgetting to bring a pedometer on a \nweekend trip) often are followed by a quick resumption of \ntracking.  In  these  cases,  someone  may  not  revisit  their \ndecision to track and the selection of a tool. \n\nAfter a longer lapse (e.g., stopping tracking for months), the \nself-tracker may not necessarily resume collecting more data. \n\n735\n\nInstead, they may resume integrating or reflecting upon their \nprevious  data,  deciding  later  whether  more  collection  is \nneeded. This decision varies by the tracker and the domain.  \n\nMODEL STAGES ACROSS DOMAINS \nIn  this  section,  we  discuss  how  our  model  describes \nself-tracking across domains. We report on themes present \nacross  all  three  domains  we  studied,  noting  exceptions \nspecific  to  particular  tracking  domains.  We  believe  the \nsimilarities in tracking experiences across domains indicate \nthe potential for the model\u2019s applicability to other domains. \n\nThis  section  contains  quotes  from  our  168  survey  and  22 \ninterview participants. We quote participants as p##, where \np1-p22  were  interviewed  and  p16-p184  were  surveyed. \nNote this means that p16-p22 completed both. \n\nDifferent Motivations for Deciding to Track \nMost  models  of  personal  informatics  and  self-monitoring \ndescribe the practices of people who engage in self-tracking \nwith  a  specific  behavior  change  goal  in  mind  [1,21,32]. \nAlthough this describes much self-tracking behavior, people \nalso  begin  and  continue  to  self-track  for  reasons  not  well \ndescribed  by  these  models.  We  describe  three  classes  of \nself-tracker motivations: behavior change, instrumentation, \ninform  how \nand  curiosity.  These \nself-trackers select, use, and lapse in tool usage. \n\ninitial  motivations \n\nBehavior Change Goals \nPrior  work  has  described  how  behavior  change  goals  can \nmotivate  someone  to  start  tracking  [15,19,22,34].  Personal \ninformatics tools support principle and program-level goals \nin Powers\u2019 categorization of goals [31]. Principle-level goals \nare relatively abstract and ideal guiding principles that one \ntries to attain, such as goals described by p5 \u201cget in better \nshape\u201d, p86 \u201cto have more control over my finances\u201d, and 92 \nothers.  Program  goals  are  more  specific  and  actionable \n(e.g., p89 \u201cget[ting] out of debt\u201d, 39 others). We identified \n48 financial trackers motivated to receive a financial touch \n[20],  such  as  p90  \u201cjust  wanted  a  clearer  snapshot  of  my \nfinances.\u201d  We  believe  such  trackers  intend  to  change  their \nbehavior if they notice something they find concerning, such \nas p164 \u201c[I] wanted to know if I should cut down on anything.\u201d \n\nEven  when  people  track  to  aid  in  behavior  change,  they \nsometimes  track  primarily  to  gain  motivation  or  increase \ntheir accountability, rather than for insights or awareness of \ntheir own behavior [2]. p72 started tracking \u201cbecause I felt I \nneeded  to  get  more  motivation  for  my  fitness\u201d,  while  p73 \ntracked  finances  \u201cto  be  accountable  with  how  I  spend  my \nmoney\u201d (mentioned by 11 and 2 others respectively).

Adding  features  that  let \npeople share progress may create channels for accountability \n[27,28], but merely having a record in the tool or online can \nalso help motivate people and make them feel accountable to \nthe  tool  [26].  For  some  people,  the  record\u2019s  support  for \naccountability is more valuable than insights derived. \n\n \n \n \n\fInstrumental Tracking Goals \nWe define instrumental tracking as tracking without the goal \nof changing a behavior. Instead, the goal is to obtain a record \nof a particular behavior, such as going to a particular place or \nwatching a particular  movie. Some  are  motivated  to  track by \nrewards  that  data  about  their  behaviors  can  unlock,  such  as \ndiscounts or badges [24]. p162 started tracking his physical \nactivity because he \u201cgot rewards points with my insurance\u201d, \nan increasingly common trend for health insurers [29]. \n\nLocation trackers often instrument to achieve social benefits. \n35 mentioned tracking to share where they went, including \np173 for practical reasons, \u201cI like to let friends know where I \nam in case I am in the area\u201d and p42 for social engagement, \n\u201cto get likes\u201d. Others were motivated to start tracking to see \nwhere others were \u201cmy friends had it so I got it too to see \nwhere they were\u201d (p107, 19 others). These social motivations \noften are related to other goals, such as p82 sharing to inform \nfriends: \u201cI ate at this Thai restaurant that I loved, so I wanted \nto share it with friends so they could check it out.\u201d \n\nCuriosity \nMany people decide to track without any behavioral goal, but \nout of curiosity about what it would be like or would offer. \nPeople described thinking tracking would be \u201cfun\u201d, \u201ccool\u201d, \n\u201cneat\u201d,  and  wanted  to  \u201ctry  it  out\u201d  (19,  12,  6,  5  people). \nCuriosity  is  often  driven  by  a  desire  to  keep  up  with  new \ntechnology, such as p68 trying Quicken because \u201cit seemed \nlike the latest way to keep up with my expenses.\u201d Curiosity \nalso  spread  socially,  such  as  for  p41  \u201ceveryone  was  using \nFoursquare and I thought I\u2019d finally jump on a bandwagon.\u201d \n\nMany phones and computers include self-tracking programs \nby  default,  such  as  Google  Now,  Apple  HealthKit,  and \nQuicken. People also start tracking because they receive apps \nand devices as gifts (10 people), they were free (7 people), \nor their \u201cphone asked if I wanted to\u201d, referring to the GPS \ntracking  permission  models  of  many  common  phone  apps \n(p63,  11  others).  These  events  often  make  people  curious \nenough  to  start  tracking,  such  as  for  p150:  \u201cit  was  offered \nfree of charge so I thought I\u2019d give it a try.\u201d \n\nDifferences by Domain \nThe  prevalence  of  tracking  motivations  varies  by  domain. \nBehavior  change  goals  were  common  reasons  for  physical \nactivity  or  financial  tracking  (82%  and  73%  of  trackers), \nwhile  instrumental  tracking  was  a  major  motivator  for \nlocation trackers (67% of trackers). Curiosity was prevalent \nacross  all  three  domains,  but  was  mentioned  by  more \nlocation  trackers  (10%,  6%,  and  20%  of  physical  activity, \nfinances,  and  location  trackers).

Location  tagging  on  large  social  networks  is \npopular  because  \u201ceveryone  else  is  using  it\u201d  (p57)  and  it  is \neasy  to  engage  with  a  large  audience.  People  also  look  to \nmaximize the rewards they receive, such as selecting a FitBit \nbecause it is supported by a work wellness program (p18). \n\nTrackers motivated by curiosity often do not actively think \nabout selecting a tool, instead beginning to use whatever tool \nprompted  their  initial  curiosity.  Frequent  media  references \nled p154 to be curious about self-tracking: \u201cI started using \nApple HealthKit since there was hype in the media about how \ngreat this app is\u201d, but it did not live up to his expectations \n\u201cI used it for less than a week and was not impressed.\u201d \n\nUsing Tools for Value and Insight \nPeople with varied tracking motivations use tools differently \nduring the collection, integration, and reflection stages of the \npersonal  informatics  model  [21],  which  we  define  as  the \npractice  of  tracking  and  acting.  This  section  separately \ndiscusses how people collect, integrate, and reflect on data, \nbut we reiterate that these processes occur simultaneously in \npractice.  We  report  on  and  discuss  differences  in  usage  in \nboth self-tracking data and self-tracker motivation. \n\nCollection \nWe notice a trend toward long-term use of current tracking \ntools (Figure 3), but people appear to abandon location and \nphysical activity tracking tools more quickly than financial \ntracking tools (45% and 44% of people abandoned tools for \nlocation  and  physical  activity  within  three  months,  versus \n26%  for  financial  tools).  Respondents  also  used  location \ntracking  tools  less  frequently  than  other  tools  (Figure  4a), \nand  many  respondents  logged  physical  activity  every  day \n(Figure 4b).

Many curiosity-motivated trackers \nwill discover another value to tracking and increase their tool \nuse,  such  as  p85,  who  started  location  tracking  because  it \n\u201cwas  a  trendy  thing  to  do,  but  later  on  I've  realized  its \nbenefits.\u201d p132 started tracking physical activity because an \napp came preinstalled on his phone, and later realized the app \nwas \u201can ideal tool to record my physical activity.\u201d \n\nLocation  trackers  tended  to  have  motivations  that  were \ninstrumental  or  curious,  use  their  tracking  tools  less \nfrequently (only 49% report tracking in the past week), and \nabandon  tracking  most  quickly  (18%  of  past  trackers  used \ntheir  tool  for  less  than  one  week).

In our survey, \n53%,  72%,  and  78%  of  physical  activity,  finances,  and \nlocation trackers had used more than one tool. Changes are \nsometimes forced by reasons outside of tool selection, such \nas changing phones ([34], \u201cI switched mobile platforms\u201d p22, \n3 others) or because the tool stopped being supported (e.g., \n\u201cMicrosoft  Money  quit  supporting  their  software\u201d  p77,  5 \nothers). We focus on people choosing to stop using a tool and \nbeginning to use another, with or without a lapse in between. \n\nAs suggested by Li et al., behavior change motivated trackers \nswitch to tools that better meet their information needs [21]. \n25  people  described  switching  to  a  new  tool  that  was \n\u201cbetter\u201d,  such  as  p186  switching  from  Quicken  \u201csomeone \nrecommended MoneyDance and I liked it a lot better\u201d and \np95 \nfrom  RunKeeper  \u201cfound  a  better  alternative \n(MapMyRun).\u201d People often describe what is better about a \nnew tool in terms of features (e.g., \u201cI wanted a more robust \nthat  would  keep  my  weight  and  body \napp  option \nmeasurements\u201d p47, 12 others), ease of use (e.g., \u201cI like my \nonline banking app better and it is easier\u201d p72), or accuracy \n(e.g., \u201cI upgraded to a smartphone with data that could track \nmy actual location and track more accurately\u201d p54). \n\nTrackers  motivated  by  behavior  change  often  use  and \ncompare multiple tools at once, then decide what tool they \nprefer.  When  p5  decided  to  try  switching  from  an  analog \npedometer  to a  FitBit,  she wore both of  them:  \u201cI  put  them \nboth  on  to  see  what  the  FitBit  would  be  like  and  compare \nthem\u201d and later returned the FitBit because it was \u201cway off in \n\n739\n\ncomparison.\u201d p121 started using their bank\u2019s tracking tools \n\u201cto compare it to other software tools\u201d, but later decided that \nother tools were better and stopped using her bank tools. \n\nFor instrumental trackers, tool switching often occurs when \na new tool offers more benefits. p57 switched from location \ntagging  on  Facebook  to  Twitter  and  Instagram  because \n\u201ceveryone moved on to other social media platforms\u2026 so I \nfollowed those trends instead.\u201d p6 described using multiple \npedometers at once, because his health plan would \u201cpick the \nbest numbers from all of those\u201d, before settling on the one \nthat gave the largest rewards. \n\nWe  did  not  observe  many  instances  of  curiosity-motivated \ntrackers  switching  tools,  perhaps  because  use  of  one  tool \ntended to satisfy their curiosity. After trying tracking, some \nof  these  trackers  developed  behavior  change  goals  and \nswitched tools that better matched their new goals. \n\nStopping Tracking \nAlthough  extended  or  repeated  lapses  often  lead  people  to \nstop  tracking,  people  also  stop  tracking  for  other  reasons. \nSome trackers motivated by behavior change stop tracking \nwhen they successfully change the behavior, and move on to \nmaintaining  their  desired behavior  [32].  p142  and 2 others \nstopped  tracking  because  they  \u201cmet  my  weight  goal.\u201d \nFor others, the behavior change is no longer necessary, \u201cI\u2019m \nnot  as  financially  strapped  as  when  I  was  using  Mint,  so \nthat\u2019s a big reason why I stopped using it\u201d (p15). \n\nInstrumental  trackers  stop  tracking when  the  benefits from \ninstrumenting  fade  or  are  withdrawn.  p164  stopped  using \nFoursquare because \u201cthe possibility of deals wasn\u2019t enticing \nenough.\u201d  For  many  social-oriented  location  trackers,  this \noccurs when others stop using the tool: \u201ceveryone else stopped \nusing it\u201d (p170, 10 others).

We supplement these \nguidelines  by  recommending  that  designers  plan  for  lapse \nand  resumption,  consider  people  migrating  between  tools, \nand support people adjusting their tracking goals. \n\nReturning to Tracking with the Same Tool after a Lapse \nIt  is  unclear how personal  informatics  tools  should behave \nwhen  someone  decides  to  resume  use  after  a  lapse.  A \nperson\u2019s historical data may be helpful for setting new goals, \nsuch  as  defining  a  new  budget  based  on  their  previous \nspending  habits.  However,  seeing  historical  data  (and \npotential failures surfaced) may be demotivating for someone \nlooking to resume use of a calorie-tracking app to lose weight. \nHistorical  data  offers  opportunities  to  bootstrap  the  data \ncollection process, but its use requires careful consideration. \n\nSome self-tracking tools passively collect information for as \nlong  as  the  tool  is  not  disabled  or  uninstalled  (e.g.,  Apple \nHealthKit, Moves, Mint). Although someone may not look \nat their data for months or even years, the tool continues to \ncollect  and  store  their  information.  It  is  unclear  what,  if \nanything,  the  tool  should do with  this historical  data  when \nsomeone  resumes  using  the  tool  after  an  extended  lapse. \nAlthough  prior  research  has  considered  the  challenge  of \npresenting  a  large  amount  of  personal  data  in  an  easily \nconsumable  manner  [3,15],  it  remains  unclear  how  to \nsummarize this data based on the reason the person resumed \ntracking. Furthermore, perhaps the passively collected data \nshould  not  be  summarized  at  all.  Instead,  the  person  may \nwant  start  over  with  a  clean  slate,  and  looking  at  their \nprevious  data  may  create  a  negative  reaction  if  they  view \ntheir previous tracking experience as a failure. \n\nEffective Migration between Tools \nWhen  describing  design  choices  for  assistive  technology, \nDawe  notes  the  difficulty  in  replacing  broken  or  outdated \ntechnology, particularly with regards to cost [13].

I don\u2019t know if that matters, sometimes it \ndoes, but usually it\u2019s something that I just kind of gave up on. \n\nThe overhead of setting up a profile, learning a new interface, \nand  losing  his  data  were  too  much  for  p11  to  consider \nswitching  tools.  While  he  desires  other  features,  saying \n\u201cI want to have an aggregate sense of how many miles I\u2019ve \nrun for the past three months\u201d, he is unwilling to switch to a \nnew  tool  and  lose  all  of  his  built-up  knowledge.  Although \nlock-in  may  be  desirable  from  an  application  or  device \nmanufacturer\u2019s  point  of  view,  personal  informatics  tools \ncould  better  support  their  users  with  designs  that  support \nevolving motivations and feature needs and allow people to \nmigrate when the tool no longer best supports their goals. \n\nSupporting Migration between Goals \nSome  curiosity  and  instrumentally-motivated  participants \nfound other benefits from their tracking tools that motivated \ntheir  sustained  tracking  even  as  they  satisfied  their  initial \ncuriosity or as the instrumental benefits faded. Others did not \nfind  such  alternative  benefits.  This  suggests  that  designers \nmay  be  able  to  do  more  to  help  people  see  benefits  in \ncontinuing to track. This might include realizing the value of \ntracking to support behavior change goals they already have, \nor even setting new goals. For example, an app that someone \nstarts to use out of curiosity regarding how active they are \ncould illustrate benefits achieved by others who started from \nthe same activity level and walked a bit more each week. \n\nIn  other  cases,  data  from  personal  informatics  applications \nmay prompt people to question their behavior. For example, \nsomeone who tracks their location to share with friends or \nreceive discounts might receive a badge for eating out often, \nor realize they check-in at restaurants much more than their \nfriends, and wonder how much they could save by cooking. \n\nCONCLUSION \nWe  offer  a  model  of  personal  informatics  informed  by  the \nperspective  of  lived  informatics,  expanding  upon  prior \nmodels based primarily in behavior change and maintenance. \nWe identify three initial motivations for tracking: the desire \nto  change  behavior,  instrumenting  for  rewards  or  social \nengagement,  and  curiosity  regarding  data  and  habits. \nOur model captures the practices of self-trackers with such \ndiverse goals, offers a better understanding of how they use \nself-tracking  tools,  and  helps  surface  relatively  unexplored \nchallenges for future designers and researchers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 57025, "end_char_idx": 60658, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "867283a2-8a27-4a74-ad97-305f4fcc311f": {"__data__": {"id_": "867283a2-8a27-4a74-ad97-305f4fcc311f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "477ab99b-3d28-4ada-bda3-f83dfdb36c39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1a6c925ff8699035da909b24fe4b494aac89e3e8c7ebf2f2218cfa4b1d2aaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a720eb0-5d3e-4978-96a0-f4b9c25b5616", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57af26588286dd5a9454aeadb1e21d9ec5e9cccda5baa43fa8e561b3814d1d51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18cd2291-7fc0-4599-a2ee-9663a43b0a97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09ba2dbeff0303b354d58c41c418154f5c8dbd003debd24bb29edc508ed5527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe thank Kelly Campbell, Monica Caraway, Season Dai, Yoanna \nDosouto,  Nicole  Fugere,  Coimbra  Jackson,  Bradley  Jacobson, \nChuck Johnston, Kim Lambert, Alex Pease, Sreedev Sidharthan, \nMaria  Suhardi,  Megan  Taylor,  and  Frank  Xu  for  their \ncontributions  through  survey  design  and  participant  interviews. \nWe  also  thank  Elena  Agapie,  Elizabeth  Bales,  Lucas  Franco \nColusso, Felicia Cordeiro, and Ravi Karkar for early feedback and \ndesign  of  visuals.
